<h1>Rules for the Louisiana Cosplayers Facebook Community</h1>
<p>
All members are required to read the rules. If your post is against the rules it will be removed and you will be issued a warning (check your Facebook message box). Details on warnings can be found at the bottom of the rules. Please do not start your post with "Not sure if this is allowed" or "Delete if not allowed." ASK an admin first and get permission. 
</p>
<div id="rules">
	<ol>
		<li>Keep all group posts on topic. This includes Cosplay projects (current, work in progress, future plans, and retired), advice on making/buying, meetups and events.</li>
		<li>Be nice and respectful in your posts and towards your fellow members. If you have a problem with another member, do not post about it in the group. This is not a place for negativity. </li>

		<li>Do not post personal information publicly. This includes: phone numbers, addresses or email addresses. Exchange information in private messages.</li>

		<li>Do not post about Religion, Politics, or controversial topics. </li>
		<li>Do not double post, spam posts, or delete your post and post it again so it goes back to the top of the page.

		<li>If you are looking to advertise a convention or an event not sponsored by Louisiana Cosplayers, message one of the admins and the team will review the request. This includes: fundraisers, movie events, non-official cosplay meetups, sewing meetups, etc.</li>
		<li>To post items For Sale: add images with descriptions to the FOR SALE album. You can then post the link of the album to the main page with a description of what you added to the album. (If you have trouble understanding these instructions, contact an admin.)</li>
		<li>Members are required to have at least ONE real profile picture. It does not need to be your current picture, but you need to have history of one.</li>
		<li>Members are required to have a Facebook name with majority English characters (not consisting entirely of foreign characters). Having an English second name in parenthesis is allowed.</li>
		<li>Blocking any one of the Admins is a bannable offense. If we are blocked, you will be removed and banned from the group immediately.</li>
	</ol>
</div>

<h2>Warnings:</h2>
<p>
Depending on the severity of the rule broken you will be issued a warning, a temporary ban, or a permanent ban. After three warnings have been issued, you will be issued a temporary ban - the length of which is decided upon by the team depending on the reasons of the warnings.
</p>
<p>
A permanent ban can be appealed after a year with a formal letter (Facebook message addressed to the admins) explaining that you understand why and how your actions lead to you being banned and what actions you will take to not break them again
</p>

<!--
<p>
  Due to the large number of members in the group we are requiring everyone to read the rules - ignorance of the rules is not an excuse. Your post will be deleted an you will recieve a message from an Admin if they deem it necessary to message you on this offense. If you have any questions about the rules, please feel free to message one of the Admins for clarification. 
  <div id="rules">
    <ol>
      <li>Please keep all Facebook group posts on topic. This includes Cosplay projects (current, WIP, future plans and retired), cons, advice on making/buying, meet-ups/events. </li>
      <li>Please keep personal chatter between you and your friends.</li>
      <li>Be nice and respectful to your fellow members. If you have a problem with a fellow member, don’t post it in the group . Please try to either sort it out privately, or notify one of the admins (privately) and we will handle it but only if conflict happens in the Facebook group.</li>
      <li>Keep all content (text and pics) <b>PG-13 or lower</b>. We do have minors in this group. Any profanity used at or against a fellow member will not be tolerated and <b>you will be issued a warning</b>. This also means linking offsite. PG-13 means no sexual content, no drug references, no alcohol references, no references to violence. This is a wholesome environment. </li>
      <li>Do not post personal information publicly on the group’s pages, including your phone number, address, etc. Not only is this spam, it’s also dangerous, as it can expose you to online predators. This is a public group and anyone, member or not, can view its content. If you wish for someone to know your number, PM them. Any personal information that is posted will be removed.</li>
      <li>Do not post personal problems dealing with relationships, marriages, divorces, and etc. Everyone in this group doesn’t need to know about your issues that you are going through in your love life. We can also not be responsible for feuds that go on between other members on your personal Facebook. If it's not in the group, it's not our responsibility to remove members. </li>
      <li>If you are looking to advertise a convention, or an event not sponsored by Louisiana Cosplayers (this includes fundraisers, movie events, non official cosplay/sewing meet ups, etc) the admins are requesting these advertisements be messaged to the admin team first for review. This rule does apply to personal fanpages as well. We have a fanpage file in here, by all means share that link but not just one fanpage.</li>
      <li><b>Blocking Admins is a bannable offense. If you block us so we can't see what you post you will be removed from the group immediately and without warning.</b></li>
      <li>Please prevent from double posting and keep things in one topic. If you can not find your post you made please inform an admin and we will find it for you to help you resurface it. Prevent from double posting to help the page be cleared and help others look for other topics besides the same one 2-3 times.</li>
      <li>FOR SALE items are to be put in the FOR SALE album on the group page. This also helps prevent clutter on the page and to help you find your post faster in an album then on a page with X amount of posts. PLEASE put your name in the post as well so people can find who the item is from and how they can contact you.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
</p>
<h3>Violations</h3>
<p>
  Please do not take strikes personally or rudely. If someone breaks the rules in the group and you do get a warning for it, it is better in the long run to talk calmly about it with one of the Admins. This makes the whole process smoother and healthier for the group. Please respect the Admins in their decisions. When you are given a warning our standard protocol is discussed by a panel of Admins.
  <ul>
    <li>Strike One / Two - A warning(s)</li>
    <li>Strike Three - Temporary ban (Time depends of the severity of the infraction)</li>
    <li>Strike Four - Permanent ban from the group (You may apply for an appeal after one year)</li>
  </ul>

<h1>Meetup Information</h1>
<p>
Meetup schedule is on the <a href="events.html">Events</a> page.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Official LAC Meetups are decided by which Admin can host them and available weekends between major conventions.</li>
	<li>Meetups might be postponed due to weather conditions.</li>
	<li>Members are allowed to share or create Unofficial meetups. The description or title must include that they are unofficial.</li>
	<li>Unofficial meetups cannot be hosted in 18+ locations. E.g. Bars or clubs</li>
	<li>Get approval from an Admin before sharing Events to the page</li>
	<li>Because of the size of the group, Facebook will not allow us to invite all LAC members to the event pages. <b>Do not be offended if you did not receive an invite, you may have to invite yourself. Check the event section and pinned posts for updates about events.</b></li>
</ul>

<h1>Meetup Rules</h1>
<p>
These are the rules for all meetups, each meetup will have specific rules (e.g. Cannot wear masks or face paint to the Zoo or the Aquarium but they are allowed at other meetups). Those rules will be included in the description for the event.
</p>
<div id="rules">
<ol>
	<li>Respect the event organizer and go to that person for questions and issues.</li>
	<li>For everyone’s safety if you see another member destroying public property or harassing another member, please report it to an admin or event organizer. Do not try to handle it yourself, we will tell them to leave or call the authorities.</li>
	<li>Abide by the rules of the location. Most meetups are at parks that have their own rules and are in public. If you think your cosplay would be considered indecent in public, use your better judgement or ask an Admin if your cosplay is inappropriate.</li>
	<li>No horseplay, drama, drugs, alcohol, fighting or cursing. Admins reserve the right to ask you to leave if you cause any disturbances.</li>
	<li>Any threats made towards anyone will not be considered role play, it will be taken as a threat and will be dealt with accordingly.</li>
	<li>You are not required to be in cosplay at meetups, it is encouraged.</li>
	<li>You are responsible for your transportation to and from the event. Posts about carpooling are allowed on event pages but the conversation must be moved to private messages afterwards (DO NOT post your address).</li>
</ol>
</div>

<!--
<p>
  We have a rotation of the major cities for the Official Meetups that are held every two months in the following cities: Baton Rouge, New Orleans, and Lafayette. (Each City has two or more representatives to host a meet which are listed.)
  <div id="rules">
    <ol>
      <li>If you wish to host a non-official meet up, you may do so. You will be responsible for the meet-up. We only ask that you host the events on days we don’t have an official Louisiana Cosplayer meet up.</li>
      <li>Keep in mind that Mother Nature likes to surprise everyone, so please watch the weather the week of the meet ups before it happens just in case it needs to be postponed. (If a meet must be postponed because of the weather or any other current events, please know that we will do our best to reschedule.)</li>
      <li>The person who organized the meet-up (official meets) is in charge and no one else, unless he/she has agreed to pass on or share leadership with one or more other members. He or She should remain with the group throughout the duration of the meet.</li>
      <li>If you have any questions or do not know who is in charge it will be in the facebook event, and the person marked as (Host) next to their name is the representative running the meet.</li>
      <li>Please respect the organizer as the leader. If you wish to help the organizer, ask first, don’t just assume leadership, this can just make things more confusing for the other members in attendance.</li>
      <li>If a member sees another attendee destroying public property or harassing another member, we ask that you report it to the host(s) so they may ask them to leave. If members who are being destructive or harassing others refuses to leave the meet, we will call the authorities. This is for everyone's safety.</li>
