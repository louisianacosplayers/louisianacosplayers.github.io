<h1>LAC Facebook Community Rules</h1>
<p>
  Due to the large number of members in the group we are requiring everyone to read the rules - ignorance of the rules is not an excuse. Your post will be deleted an you will recieve a message from an Admin if they deem it necessary to message you on this offense. If you have any questions about the rules, please feel free to message one of the Admins for clarification. 
  <div id="rules">
    <ol>
      <li>Please keep all Facebook group posts on topic. This includes Cosplay projects (current, WIP, future plans and retired), cons, advice on making/buying, meet-ups/events. </li>
      <li>Please keep personal chatter between you and your friends.</li>
      <li>Be nice and respectful to your fellow members. If you have a problem with a fellow member, don’t post it in the group . Please try to either sort it out privately, or notify one of the admins (privately) and we will handle it but only if conflict happens in the Facebook group.</li>
      <li>Keep all content (text and pics) <b>PG-13 or lower</b>. We do have minors in this group. Any profanity used at or against a fellow member will not be tolerated and <b>you will be issued a warning</b>. This also means linking offsite. PG-13 means no sexual content, no drug references, no alcohol references, no references to violence. This is a wholesome environment. </li>
      <li>Do not post personal information publicly on the group’s pages, including your phone number, address, etc. Not only is this spam, it’s also dangerous, as it can expose you to online predators. This is a public group and anyone, member or not, can view its content. If you wish for someone to know your number, PM them. Any personal information that is posted will be removed.</li>
      <li>Do not post personal problems dealing with relationships, marriages, divorces, and etc. Everyone in this group doesn’t need to know about your issues that you are going through in your love life. We can also not be responsible for feuds that go on between other members on your personal Facebook. If it's not in the group, it's not our responsibility to remove members. </li>
      <li>If you are looking to advertise a convention, or an event not sponsored by Louisiana Cosplayers (this includes fundraisers, movie events, non official cosplay/sewing meet ups, etc) the admins are requesting these advertisements be messaged to the admin team first for review. This rule does apply to personal fanpages as well. We have a fanpage file in here, by all means share that link but not just one fanpage.</li>
      <li><b>Blocking Admins is a bannable offense. If you block us so we can't see what you post you will be removed from the group immediately and without warning.</b></li>
      <li>Please prevent from double posting and keep things in one topic. If you can not find your post you made please inform an admin and we will find it for you to help you resurface it. Prevent from double posting to help the page be cleared and help others look for other topics besides the same one 2-3 times.</li>
      <li>FOR SALE items are to be put in the FOR SALE album on the group page. This also helps prevent clutter on the page and to help you find your post faster in an album then on a page with X amount of posts. PLEASE put your name in the post as well so people can find who the item is from and how they can contact you.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
</p>
<h3>Violations</h3>
<p>
  Please do not take strikes personally or rudely. If someone breaks the rules in the group and you do get a warning for it, it is better in the long run to talk calmly about it with one of the Admins. This makes the whole process smoother and healthier for the group. Please respect the Admins in their decisions. When you are given a warning our standard protocol is discussed by a panel of Admins.
  <ul>
    <li>Strike One / Two - A warning(s)</li>
    <li>Strike Three - Temporary ban (Time depends of the severity of the infraction)</li>
    <li>Strike Four - Permanent ban from the group (You may apply for an appeal after one year)</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h1>Meetup Rules</h1>
<p>
  We have a rotation of the major cities for the Official Meetups that are held every two months in the following cities: Baton Rouge, New Orleans, and Lafayette. (Each City has two or more representatives to host a meet which are listed.)
  <div id="rules">
    <ol>
      <li>If you wish to host a non-official meet up, you may do so. You will be responsible for the meet-up. We only ask that you host the events on days we don’t have an official Louisiana Cosplayer meet up.</li>
      <li>Keep in mind that Mother Nature likes to surprise everyone, so please watch the weather the week of the meet ups before it happens just in case it needs to be postponed. (If a meet must be postponed because of the weather or any other current events, please know that we will do our best to reschedule.)</li>
      <li>The person who organized the meet-up (official meets) is in charge and no one else, unless he/she has agreed to pass on or share leadership with one or more other members. He or She should remain with the group throughout the duration of the meet.</li>
      <li>If you have any questions or do not know who is in charge it will be in the facebook event, and the person marked as (Host) next to their name is the representative running the meet.</li>
      <li>Please respect the organizer as the leader. If you wish to help the organizer, ask first, don’t just assume leadership, this can just make things more confusing for the other members in attendance.</li>
      <li>If a member sees another attendee destroying public property or harassing another member, we ask that you report it to the host(s) so they may ask them to leave. If members who are being destructive or harassing others refuses to leave the meet, we will call the authorities. This is for everyone's safety.</li>
    </ol>
